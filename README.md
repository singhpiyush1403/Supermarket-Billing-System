# Supermarket-Billing-System
This Java-based Supermarket Billing System allows users to input item details (name, quantity, and price), calculate subtotals, apply tax rates, and apply discounts to generate a final bill. The program uses ArrayList to store item details and implements object-oriented programming (OOP) principles with an Item class.
